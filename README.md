AI-Integrated MERN Stack Website for a Christian Learning NGO with Real-Time Chatbot Support

This project involves the development of an AI-powered web platform for a Christian Learning NGO, aimed at providing accessible and high-quality technical education in domains such as MERN, MEAN, AWS, Azure, Android, Django, and Java. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), the platform offers a seamless user experience with dynamic course listings, enrollment management, and learner support. A key feature of the platform is its integration with a real-time AI chatbot, designed to assist users by answering queries, guiding navigation, and providing instant support, thus enhancing the overall learning journey.
